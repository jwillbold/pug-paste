# pug-paste

An Atom IDE plugin that automatically transforms HTML code to PUG code, when pasting into a PUG file.
The plugin first checks whether the pasting target is a pug file. Afterwards, it is checked whether the pasted
text is HTML. If this is the case, the pasted text gets converted.

``<head>``, ``<body>`` and ``<html>`` tags are ignored.

The HTML to PUG conversion is done via the node.js package 'html2pug'.
https://www.npmjs.com/package/html2pug

## Usage
Enable the auto-conversion through "pug-paste:enable-clipboard-transform".

1. Press ``Ctrl + Shift + P``
2. Type ``pug-paste``
3. Select ``enable/disable/toggle-clipboard-transform``

## Install

``apm install pug-paste``

Or search ``pug-paste`` in the packages section of Atom.

## Configuration
Both, the detection whether the current file is a PUG file and whether the current code is HTML code are checked
with regexes. Both can be modified.
